			<h1>WHY <span style="color: rgb(142, 121, 211); font-weight: 13900;">ROGUE</span> AT NYU TANDON?</h1>

			<h2>Rogue Aerospace is New York University&#39;s only rocketry association 
				dedicated to the advancement and exploration of aerospace. <br><br>

				We are a student organization and Vertically Integrated Projects 
				(VIP) Team that seeks to educate and provide hands-on experience 
				in engineering, design, and project management for students of all 
				disciplines and skills. From mechatronics, to CAD, to dynamics 
				simulation software, our team is at the forefront of aerospace
				innovation at NYU Tandon.<br><br>

				We are one of the fastest growing teams at NYU Tandon and 
				have gained significant recognition on campus, competing with 
				even the oldest and established of teams.<br><br>

				As a Vertically Integrated Program, we give students the 
				opportunity to participate in research and design with hands on 
				experience in rocketry and aerospace engineering while receiving
				course credit.</h2>

			<h1>WHAT DO WE DO?

			<h2>On the Rogue Aerospace team, we seek to design, build, analyze, 
				and launch resuable rockets, giving students hands-on exposure and 
				experience in the rapidly developing aerospace industry. <br> <br>

				In 2019-2020, we competed in the Battle of the Rockets competition, 
				a prestigious intercollegiate rocketry competition aimed at testing the 
				bound of rocketry and payload designs.<br> <br>

				This competition require the team to not only build a rocket, but to also 
				carry a payload, a rover, designed to mimic NASA&#39;s Curiosity 
				Mars Rover, up to 1000 feet and return safely! We attained third place 
				for the 2019-2020 season, and are now setting out sights on a larger 
				goal, the NASA Student Launch Initiative!
				<br> <br>
				The NASA Student Launch Initiative, or NASA SLI, is an elite nationwide 
				competition designed to test the skills and knowledge of the student 
				team. For the NASA SLI, we must design, build, and test a rocket that
				 can reach between 3,500 and 5,500 feet with an onboard payload! 
				During the flight, the payload must separate from the rocket and 
				land safely on its own, taking a 360 degree panoramic photo of 
				the landing area.</h2>

			<h1><h2>
				This is the largest scale project that we have done so far, and we hope 
				to set our sights on the prize! In addition, the team has also integrated 
				the SAE Aero Design competition within the team. 
				This competition challenges student teams to design, build, and test 
				model RC planes of different classes, namely distinguished by size and 
				power. <br><br>
				Due to the growing nature of the team we believe that branching out 
				and giving student more aerospace opportunities within the team 
				would continue to add those with the desire to learn more about 
				aerospace and to have the skills to succeed in the future!</h2>

			<h1>OUR STORY

			<h2>Rogue Aerospace was founded by 4 people with big dreams and even 
				bigger rockets. We saw that NYU did not have a large scale rocketry 
				team, and we sought to change that. Our first steps were to establish 
				ourselves as professional rocketeers, with 8 members with 
				High Powered Rocketry, or HPR certification. As of Fall 2019, 
				all 8 members have HPR 1 certification, with one member having 
				HPR 2 certification. <br><br>
				
				Our activity and involvement at NYU Tandon has skyrocketed, with 
				our induction into the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program 
				at NYU Tandon, which has provided us with resources that we could 
				not have dreamed of just mere months ago. As a result of being
				 under NYU&#39;s project umbrella, we have been given opportunities to
				 showcase our achievements to influential members of the community,
				 such as Chandrika Tandon, the namesake for our school, as well as 
				our new Dean Jelena Kovačević!.</h2>
